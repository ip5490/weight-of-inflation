Data used in "Poor Households and the Weight of Inflation" by Schulz &amp; Ipsen (2025). mimeo.

Folder demand_tables_figaro contains expenditure- and income-weighted demand tables based on i) COICOP income-dependent consumption by purpose data from Eurostat and ii) sector-level household demand based on FIGARO input-output data. The data sets were merged using matching matrices provided by Cai and Vandyck (2020). A detailed description of the process can be found in the supplementary material of our paper.
